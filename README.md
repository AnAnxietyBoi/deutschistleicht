# deutschistleicht
This is source code for a website deutschistleicht.si, made in 2018-2019, with purpose to help people learn German irregular verbs. Code, comments and website are in Slovene as it was intended for myself and my classmates. Source code also includes other files for hosting on my own server (Raspberry pi zero w with DietPi os and Nginx). Quality of code is pretty horrible, because I was just starting to learn html, css, javascript and self-hosting. I tried to make this website fast and small, so no CMS, js frameworks or unnecessary libraries (except for char.js for creating graphs), just plain html, css and javascript. There may be some missing files in older versions and some unfinished features in the latest unreleased version.
